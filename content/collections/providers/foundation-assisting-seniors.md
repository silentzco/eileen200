  Established in 2002 by Favil West and Chuck Davis, the Foundation Assisting Seniors' (FAS) mission is to assist seniors in times of illness, recovery, confinement at home, coping with loss of a loved one, and other senior challenges. We formed this organization because we saw firsthand how our own parents and neighbors struggled with things such as transportation and normal household chores during their golden years. 

  Since 2002, FAS has responded to over 360,000 assists. The HOWRU™ program has saved 11 lives. FAS is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit public benefit corporation.

  It is the ultimate goal of the Foundation to improve the overall quality of life for seniors and veterans by ensuring that they remain as safe and comfortable as possible in their own home as they age. With the support of individual and corporate donors, we look forward to continuing our roles and expanding our resources to help more seniors and veterans in our communities.
